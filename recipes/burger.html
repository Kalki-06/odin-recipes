    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A burger, an iconic staple in global cuisine, is a symphony of flavors and textures. Juicy beef patties or plant-based alternatives are nestled between soft, toasted buns, adorned with crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and slices of tangy pickles. A slather of creamy mayo or tangy mustard adds depth, while melted cheese binds it all together. Whether enjoyed simply or piled high with extras like bacon or avocado, a well-crafted burger promises satisfaction in every bite, making it a perennial favorite for casual meals or indulgent treats.</p>
